# Sunbro

Some code that I use to crawl the web at scale with Poltergeist and
PhantomJS. Uses some code from the venerable [anemone gem](https://github.com/chriskite/anemone).
Released in the spirit of jolly cooperation.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sunbro'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sunbro

## Usage

TODO: At some point, I'll write some real docs and some specs. In
my own apps this code gets tested in other parts of my spec suite,
so I've never written dedicated specs for it.
